# Palindrome-checker

 **Web app that checks if a string is a palindrome**

----------------------------------

This is a simple web app that checks if a string is a palindrome, it will ignore any marks and blank spaces, capitalization as well, thus, strings like "Lewd did I live, & evil I did dwel" will work.

It has been made using native JS, CSS and HTML.

I have made this app as an exercise, but also to learn more and practice on my front end and general programming skills and knowledge.

You can try out the app <a href="https://vladislav-ss.github.io/palindrome-checker/">HERE (GitHub pages)</a>.

Thank you for checking this out.
